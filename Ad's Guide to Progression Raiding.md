# Ad's Guide to Progression Raiding
This guide is intended for mid-to-late CE progression raiding. Early CE/HoF and groups not pushing for CE at all have slightly different requirements.

### Main goals

These are the order in which you should prioritize your progression.
#### Tanks
1. Do not die
    > Early in progression, overusing your defensives is encouraged. Ask for externals before you're even certain you need it. More important than any other goal, you must not die until the raid is wiping. Once you're comfortable with a phase, start thinking about optimizing your CDs and externals.
2. Make sure the boss/adds are where they need to be
    > As a tank, you are expected to be the leader of the melee DPS. It is up to you to make sure that they are able to be in the position they need to be in.
3. Save your fellow tank
    > Only after #1 and #2 are done, you should start thinking about what you can do to help out the other tank.
4. Do damage
    > An extremely distant fourth. Only after you are comfortable with the rest of the fight do you start worrying about optimizing your damage
#### Healers
1. Use your cooldowns at the same timing in every pull
    > It's important that other healers are able to learn when they need to spam and when they can focus on other things. If you are moving your cooldowns around it makes it much harder for them to learn this. That's not to say you can't change where to use cooldowns, but it should be a conversation with the other healers/raid lead. 
2. Be in the right position
    > Often as a healer you're spending less time looking at your feet, so it's important to keep this in mind as a high priority. Don't block other people from going where they need to go, and make sure you go where you need to go.
3. Do mechanics
    > If you must choose between someone dying and doing a mechanic that no one else can do, you choose the mechanic. If you believe this is likely to be a problem again, bring it up and make sure someone else is doing the mechanic.
4. Heal to prevent deaths
    > This sounds like it should be goal #1, but it isn't. You already know how to do this one.
5. Do damage/save mana
    > An extremely distant fifth, and only after everything else is mastered. It is better to run out of mana when the boss is at 50% health than even thinking about saving mana before you're sure you need to.

#### Ranged DPS
1. Be in the same place every pull
    > Figuring out where you need to be should be priority number one. You need to find a place where you can plant and blast, while still being able to do whatever else the fight requires you to do. Think about using utility to get where you need to be faster.
2. Do mechanics
    > Always more important than damage is making sure a mechanic gets done. If a mechanic is regularly happening right when you use your cooldowns and the mechanic allows it, bring that up with the raid and see if there's someone else able to do deal with it while you blast.
3. Don't die
    > Early in progression, overusing your personals is a good idea. Later in progression, the only use you have for personals is to prevent you or someone else from dying. In general, this is extremely hard to predict for any given usage of personals, so go by your gut and err on the side of more personals rather than less.
4. Cooldown timing
    > Early in progression you just send your cooldowns as soon as they come up. You continue to do this until something happens that forces you to change it. Downtime in the fight, damage that doesn't matter, and damage checks are the only reasons you should hold cooldowns.
5. ABC
    > Once all else is mastered, you focus on the ABCs. Always Be Casting.

#### Melee DPS
One thing you won't see here that you might expect is positioning in the boss arena. This is the job of the tanks, not yours.

1. Spread/stack
    > Nearly every boss has at least one mechanic that makes the fight easier if the melee are stacked vs spread. As an example, if a boss will sometimes mark a player to go do something, you should be spread to make it easier to see when that mechanic is on you. In the spread scenario, pick an angle on the boss and use that same angle for the whole fight. Even in the case where being spread is the best play, you should still try to be close enough to benefit from AOE heals -- don't stand on the opposite side of dragons if you don't need to.
2. Do mechanics
    > Always more important than damage is making sure a mechanic gets done. If a mechanic is regularly happening right when you use your cooldowns and the mechanic allows it, bring that up with the raid and see if there's someone else able to deal with it while you blast.
3. Don't die
    > Early in progression, overusing your personals is a good idea. Later in progression, the only use you have for personals is to prevent you or someone else from dying. In general, this is extremely hard to predict for any given usage of personals, so go by your gut and err on the side of more personals rather than less.
4. Cooldown timing
    > Early in progression you just send your cooldowns as soon as they come up. You continue to do this until something happens that forces you to change it. Downtime in the fight, damage that doesn't matter, and damage checks are the only reasons you should hold cooldowns.
5. Uptime
    > Once all else is mastered, you focus on getting as high an uptime on any given target as possible. Sometimes this means leaving the boss to hit adds before the boss goes immune, sometimes it means leaving adds before they are dead.


### Talents
> Generally speaking, most specs have talents that don't function on some boss fights. Knockbacks, dispells, roots, stuns, etc. As an example, the #1 marksman log on mythic Gallywix could have given up two talents that they never used to take https://www.wowhead.com/spell=459466/ghillie-suit It didn't matter (they still killed the boss), but blizzard gave us the ability to change talents whenever you want, so you should.

### Positioning
> Before the boss is even pulled, find a spot on the floor and go there every single pull. Don't change it without a good reason. Continue to do the same thing once the boss is pulled, find a spot, go there and don't change it without a good reason.
> 
> Early in progression and after each movement during the fight, think about where you are and if it's the most optimal, feel free to stop DPS/healing to do this for a few seconds if you need to. It's important that once you're dozens of pulls into a boss, you're consistently reacting the same way to whatever the boss is doing. Mistakes here are one of the reasons early phases even after a hundred pulls are still inconsistent.

### Movement
> At all times, put some of your focus into knowing where you need to go next. If mechanic XYZ happens, where will you go? This is a place where it is okay for your performance to suffer for a few seconds while you think about it. In the long run, you'll likely perform better by having everything pre-planned.
>
> Later in progression, you should have the earlier parts of the fight down to a point where you don't need to think much about it anymore. This is a normal part of progression and once you get there it's very easy to tunnel vision. Before each pull, make a mental note of at which point in the fight you aren't completely comfortable with yet, and make sure you bring back your full focus when the raid gets to that point.

### Optimization
> The following sections are a guideline for how you should think about improving deep into progression. This is for when you're dozens or even hundreds of pulls deep.
> 
> By this point, you should have your cooldowns and defensives planned out for nearly every mechanical variation that has occurred. Some bosses are hard no matter how much practice you get, but you shouldn't be *surprised* by what's happening. You should have a plan in place for every mechanic variation, even if you fail to execute that plan sometimes.
>
> You should at this point be predictable to your fellow raiders. If they're standing beside you, they should know what you're going to do when a given mechanic happens, because they've seen you do it before. In addition to you not being surprised, you should not be surprising other people. Again this is not to say you won't make mistakes and surprise them with that. It's about knowing what you're going to do, not necessarily being perfect at execution.

#### Optimization applicable to all roles
> If people are regularly dying at a certain point in the fight, but you're never scared, can you help them out by moving around your personals to make sure you don't eat any smart heals? If you're the one who is regularly scared at a certain point, ask if there's an available external that you can get at that point.
> 
> If there is a portion of the fight with a high mental load that you are consistently struggling with, think about changes that could be made to make it easier for you. Can someone else do it? Can you do it in a different way that's easier? Does moving the boss make it easier?
>
> This tip isn't as applicable to healers, but I highly recommend spending as much time as you need to in front of a target dummy so that your rotation is something that requires almost no mental load. For some people this might just be a few minutes of pressing their buttons, but for most of us, we could be spending ***hours*** on a target dummy before hitting any sort of diminishing returns. 

#### Tank optimization
> At this point, you should be bored. You should be so used to doing the exact same thing every pull and watching the raid die around you that you want to scream. There's the rare boss where you actually get to do something, but for the most part, welcome to hell tank friends. Slam out as much DPS as you can in this stage of progression.
> 
> When a new section of the fight is reached, you need to immediately snap back into the unkillable wall mind-set. Use everything. Your only job is once again Do Not Die and make sure the boss is where it needs to be. Running out of defensives because you used way too many in a new section of the fight is okay, honestly it's encouraged. That means you were doing your job.

#### Ranged DPS optimization
> Strategy changes can often happen late into progression, when they do, you should think about how that affects what you've been doing. If lust got moved, does that change how you want to use your CDs? If you've been consistently making a damage check, should you consider moving your CDs around?
>
> Think about your personals. Could they be better used to help increase your DPS? If a mechanic that requires you to dodge a bunch is happening, can you use a major personal there and get away with just eating the mechanic? Is there a better place you could stand to avoid the whole mechanic?
>
> When a new section of the fight is reached, feel free to put practically zero effort into maximizing your DPS. Go back to an early progression mindset.

#### Melee DPS optimization
> Strategy changes can often happen late into progression, when they do, you should think about how that affects what you've been doing. If lust got moved, does that change how you want to use your CDs? If you've been consistently making a damage check, should you consider moving your CDs around?
>
> If you're having to use a lot of brain power dodging mechanics or running around, is there a better place the boss could be placed to make it easier? If you're a paladin or similar, could you just use bubble and ignore it?

#### Healer optimization
> In much harder progression than this guide is aimed at, any increase to raw HPS is good. For what we're going for, it's not. The only healing that ever matters, in any content, at any level, is healing that prevents someone from dying. At the level this guide is aimed at, you will likely be capable of dumping out so much raw HPS that much of it is wasted.
>
> This is a difference that has very subtle gearing implications. Sometimes the BIS trinket isn't actually the best at preventing people from dying, it's just the best at raw HPS. Take two imaginary trinkets. One provides a 6% intellect increase, which is basically the same as a 6% raw HPS increase, and another trinket that has a direct heal proc and overall provides a 3% HPS increase but only ever heals people when they are below 30% health. I hope it's clear which trinket is more important where we're going.
>
> There are also subtle gameplay implications. When the entire raid is taking heavy damage, yes you should continue to dump out as much raw HPS as you can. But when it's just a few people with a debuff? You should use your most GCD efficient heal that will keep them alive. For example, just drop a single HOT on them and let the smart heals take care of the rest. Healer DPS sucks, and has for a long time now. However as much as it sucks, it's still worth doing. The goal should be to do as much damage as you can without letting anyone die. Sometimes as a druid it's better to just sit in cat form and hit the boss while the other healers take care of the healing, only popping out when you need to ramp for a damage event. When looking at logs, your healing parse is irrelevant. The two stats you want to look at are people dying and your DPS parse, optimize for those.
>
> Now that you're comfortable with the fight, conserving mana starts the instant the boss is pulled. If the boss fight is over about 6 minutes long, rip your first mana pot early (or consider using a DPS pot), you'll get another one near the end. The old advice of matching your mana bar to the boss's health is a good starting point, but isn't good advice once you're deep into progression. You should have some idea of how much you need to conserve mana by this point. Continuing with the idea in the last paragraph, it's possible that you might end the boss fight with well over half mana because you were able to spend so much time DPSing.
>
> Once you reach a new portion of the fight that you're less comfortable with, you immediately stop doing any damage or mana conservation and go back to an early progression mind set.
