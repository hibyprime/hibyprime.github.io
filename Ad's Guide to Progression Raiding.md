# Ad's Guide to Progression Raiding
This guide is intended for mid-to-late CE progression raiding. Early CE/HoF has different requirements.

### Main goals

These are the order in which you should prioritize your progression.
#### Tanks
1. Do not die
	> Early in progression, overusing your defensives is encouraged. Ask for externals before you're even certain you need it. More important than an any other goal, you must not die until the raid is wiping. Once you're comfortable with a phase, start thinking about optimizing your CDs and externals.
2. Make sure the boss/adds are where they needs to be
	> As a tank, you are expected to be the leader of the melee DPS. It is up to you to make sure that they are able to be in the position they need to be in.
3. Save your fellow tank
	> Only after #1 and #2 are done, you should start thinking about what you can do to help out the other tank.
4. Do damage
	> An extremely distant fourth. Only after you are comfortable with the rest of the fight do you start worrying about optimizing your damage
#### Healers
1. Use your cooldowns at the same timing in every pull
	> It's important that other healers are able to learn when they need to spam and when they can focus on other things. If you are moving your cooldowns around it makes it much harder for them to learn this. That's not to say you can't change where to use cooldowns, but it should be a conversation with the other healers/raid lead. 
2. Be in the right position
	> Often as a healer you're spending less time looking at your feet, so it's important to keep this in mind as a high priority. Don't block other people from going where they need to go, and make sure you go where you need to go.
3. Do mechanics
	> If you must choose between someone dying and doing a mechanic that no one else can do, you choose the mechanic. If you believe this is likely to be a problem again, bring it up and make sure someone else is doing the mechanic.
4. Heal to prevent deaths
	> This sounds like it should be goal #1, but it isn't. You already know how to do this one.
5. Do damage/save mana
	> An extremely distant fifth, and only after everything else is mastered. It is better to run out of mana when the boss is at 50% health than even thinking about saving mana before you're sure you need to.

#### Ranged DPS
1. Be in the same place every pull
	> Figuring out where you need to be should be priority number one. You need to find a place where you can plant and blast, while still being able to do whatever else the fight requires you to do. Think about using utility to get where you need to be faster.
2. Do mechanics
	> Always more important than damage is making sure a mechanic gets done. If a mechanic is regularly happening right when you use your cooldowns and the mechanic allows it, bring that up with the raid and see if there's someone else able to do deal with it while you blast.
3. Don't die
	> Early in progression, overusing your personals is a good idea. Later in progression, the only use you have for personals is to prevent you or someone else from dying. In general, this is extremely hard to predict for any given usage of personals, so go by your gut and err on the side of more personals rather than less.
4. Cooldown timing
	> Early in progression you just send your cooldowns as soon as they come up. You continue to do this until something happens that forces you to change it. Downtime in the fight, damage that doesn't matter, and damage checks are the only reasons you should hold cooldowns.
5. ABC
	> Once all else is mastered, you focus on the ABCs. Always Be Casting.

#### Melee DPS
One thing you won't see here that you might expect is positioning in the boss arena. This is the job of the tanks, not yours.

1. Spread/stack
	> Nearly every boss has at least one mechanic that makes the fight easier if the melee are stacked vs spread. As an example, if a boss will sometimes mark a player to go do something, you should be spread to make it easier to see when that mechanic is on you. In the spread scenario, pick an angle on the boss and use that same angle for the whole fight. Even in the case where being spread is the best play, you should still try to be close enough to benefit from AOE heals -- don't stand on the opposite side of dragons if you don't need to.
2. Do mechanics
	> Always more important than damage is making sure a mechanic gets done. If a mechanic is regularly happening right when you use your cooldowns and the mechanic allows it, bring that up with the raid and see if there's someone else able to do deal with it while you blast.
3. Don't die
	> Early in progression, overusing your personals is a good idea. Later in progression, the only use you have for personals is to prevent you or someone else from dying. In general, this is extremely hard to predict for any given usage of personals, so go by your gut and err on the side of more personals rather than less.
4. Cooldown timing
	> Early in progression you just send your cooldowns as soon as they come up. You continue to do this until something happens that forces you to change it. Downtime in the fight, damage that doesn't matter, and damage checks are the only reasons you should hold cooldowns.
5. Uptime
	> Once all else is mastered, you focus on getting as high an uptime on any given target as possible. Sometimes this means leaving the boss to hit adds before the boss goes immune, sometimes it means leaving adds before they are dead.


### Talents
> Generally speaking, most specs have talents that don't function on some boss fights. Knockbacks, dispells, roots, stuns, etc. As an example, the #1 marksman log on mythic Gallywix could have given up two talents that they never used to take https://www.wowhead.com/spell=459466/ghillie-suit It didn't matter (they still killed the boss), but blizzard gave us the ability to change talents whenever you want, so you should.

### Positioning
> Before the boss is even pulled, find a spot on the floor and go there every single pull. Don't change it without a good reason. Continue to do the same thing once the boss is pulled, find a spot, go there and don't change it without a good reason.
> 
> Early in progression and after each movement during the fight, think about where you are and if it's the most optimal, feel free to stop DPS/healing to do this for a few seconds if you need to. It's important that once you're dozens of pulls into a boss, you're consistently reacting the same way to whatever the boss is doing. Mistakes here are one of the reasons early phases even after a hundred pulls are still inconsistent.
